# NLP with Markov Chain
It turns out that one can build simple Natural Language Processing model with Markov Chain. A Markov Chain is built given several text files that contain stories about Sherlock Holmes. Initializing the initial word, the model can randomly generate stories in Sherlock Holmes writing style. It is quite interesting to see that such a simple model gives correct grammatical structure and somewhat meaningful sentences.
