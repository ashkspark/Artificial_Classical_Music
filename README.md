# Artificial_Classical_Music
Machine Learning Generated Classical Music
The goal of this note is to use Recurrent Neural Network to be able to generate new music by training a predictive model using available music tracks. In the future commuications, we test combing different genres of music to generate new generes. In the following you may find some of the useful links to start with artificial music generation:
